## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my gratitude for the support provided by the Erasmus+ Short Mobility Grant, which facilitated my exchange between the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. This project was made possible through this collaboration and funding.
