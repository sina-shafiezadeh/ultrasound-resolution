# ultrasound-resolution
This repository has focused on a project related to the increasing resolution of ultrasound images, including evaluation image quality assessment, generating synthetic images by image augmentation, and generating high-resolution images by generative adversarial neural networks (GANs).

## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my gratitude for the support provided by the Erasmus+ Short Mobility Grant, which facilitated my exchange between the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. This project was made possible through this collaboration and funding.
